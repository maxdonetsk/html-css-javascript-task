## Test Assignment

####HTML & CSS coding
1. Create a html & css layout;
2. Add responsiveness layout when you resize the browser window:
* Indentation along the edges of the blocks must be not less than 100px.
* Blocks have floating width 190 - 300 (px).
*Background image should be to lay the entire area of the document.
* With decrease of the window, the third block has to jump in the second row and stretch the width of the first row.
* With a further decrease, blocks should be one under the other.

* Try to make your code readable and modular.

####JavaScript coding
3. Add the "Load more” button (design and layout in its sole discretion).
* Take data from items.json (it is possible to change the path to images and content at will).
* By adding, new blocks should be added directly under the previous.
4. Add a switch "Enable infinite scrolling" (design and layout in its sole discretion).
* After switching on of that mode - blocks must be loaded on the mouse scroll and the "Load" button should be disabled (or should not be visible on the screen).
* When you turn off the mode - nothing happens with mouse scroll and must return to the "Load more” functionality.
